* Tests!!!!
  Unit, system and performance tests

* Refactoring!!!
  - We don't need casock::rpc::protobuf::api::RpcService anymore. This class was created to encapsulate RPCChannel in the client side of Google Protocols RPC, but now we are calling RPCChannel directly.

* Documentation!!!
	- We need Doxygen comments;
	- We need update the UML diagrams in astah-community document (doc/casocklib.asta)
